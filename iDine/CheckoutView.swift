    // Rather than us asking to watch changes by hand, we instead bind our picker to a property on our struct, so that when the picker changes SwiftUI automatically changes the property too. And, just like environment objects, this will cause SwiftUI to re-invoke our body property so any changes are visible.

    // @State works similarly to @EnvironmentObject in that if the object changes it automatically refreshed our UI,
    // but it's designed for simple local values like integers and strings.
    
    // If you want to use simple values that are used only by the current view you should use @State for your property wrapper. Apple also recommends you mark those properties as private to reiterate that they arenâ€™t designed for external access.
